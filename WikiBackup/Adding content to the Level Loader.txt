Adding content to the loader is very simple.

For most things, just access the appropriate dictionary in LevelLoaderPlugin.Instance.

For example, to add a room texture to the loader, add an entry to LevelLoaderPlugin.Instance.roomTextureAliases.

Below are instructions for how to add the few types that aren't as simple.

# Rooms
Unlike BB+, the level loader does not store the color, room category, room type, or door materials in the file. Instead, it uses the RoomSettings class to store the settings for rooms, where the id is the key in the LevelLoaderPlugin.Instance.roomSettings dictionary. To add a room to the loader, create the RoomSettings class with the settings for your room, and then add it to LevelLoaderPlugin.Instance.roomSettings

# Exits
To add an exit type to the loader, create a LoaderExitData class, set BOTH of the fields, and add it to LevelLoaderPlugin.Instance.exitDatas

# Structures
To add a structure type to the loader, you'll have to create a LoaderStructureData class.

This class contains two fields, structure, which is the prefab for your structure, and prefabAliases, a dictionary used to convert string keys to their respective prefabs when generating StructureData.

Once you've created this class, add it to LevelLoaderPlugin.Instance.structureAliases
