PLANS:

Figure out full 3D rotations
Create a base class for most of the editor objects so we dont have to keep re-implementing the same interfaces and adding extra dummy components (Move ValidatePosition here)
Consider tutorial? (Save for public release?)
Create more EditorTool bases (STOP RE-USING DOOR TOOL!)
